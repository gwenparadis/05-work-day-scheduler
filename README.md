# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project is a work day scheduler, allowing the user to see the current date in the header and current hour highlighted in red. In addition to this, past hours are highlighted in gray and future hours are highlighted in green. This project intends to showcase the skills that I have learned in JavaScript, including moment.js() and localStorage functions, along with an aesthetic html and css design. Throughout development, I learned about the functionality of moment.js(), addEventListener(), and localStorage to create appropriate functionality of the given elements.

## Installation

This webpage can be accessed on Github Pages, at the link:

## Usage

Once the webpage has been accessed using the Installation guidelines above, the user can edit the text in the text boxes, as desired. The intent is for the user to write their desired tasks or plans for that day in the text box that best matches the time range of the activity. The user can then click on the save button at the end of that row, setting the edited text to Local Storage. This allows the user to continue to access their additions to the webpage even after they refresh the page. The date and time will remain current throughout use.

## Credits

This project was derived from source code provided from the UNH Coding Bootcamp. The original code included the CSS styling and most of the html, excluding the timeblocks, row format, text input boxes, and save buttons. The javascript is completely original.
